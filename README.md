# OGC Standards Tracker

Please feel free to provide any change requests on existing Standards, documents in work, or new requirements for standardization here. Please first attempt to search for an item before submitting a duplicate. If an issue or request does not already exist, please file a request per the instructions below. Note: You will need to create your GitHub account prior to filing a request.

Below is some helpful information to get you started:

*What is a Change Request?*
If you believe you identified an inconsistency, omission, typographic or grammatical error, or problem with a table or figure, AND you have a solution, then you have what it takes to submit a Change Request. That is, you are requesting that the publishing organization make a change to the standard.

*What is a Requirement?*
A requirement is a request for an organization to add or support something that it does not already cover or support. This might be a new feature or a new standard. It might need to spawn a New Work Item (ISO) or new Standards Working Group (OGC).

## How to Submit a Change Request
The first step in submitting an OGC Change Request is to log into GitHub.  That may require you to create an account.  Once you are logged in, you can go to *Issues* and click on the green "New Issue" button in the upper right of the page.  From there, fill out as much information as you deem necessary for the Standards Working Group to understand the issue or problem and determine a way forward. The more information you submit, the easier it is to find a resolution.

## Change Request Proposals (CRP) to an OGC Standard
At any time, any OGC member or non-member can submit a CRP. A CRP allows for the formal documentation of a proposed change to an existing, adopted OGC Standard or Abstract Specification Topic. The change could be an identified error (see Corrigendum (errata) Changes to OGC Standards and Best and Community Practices), an inconsistency, a requested enhancement, or a major proposed enhancement.

CRPs are used as the basis for new SWG work items. The SWG must consider proposed changes and enhancements.

### 8.7.1. Submission of Change Request Proposals
A CRP shall be submitted to the OGC by posting to the Public Change Request page or to the Issue tracker for the Standard in question.

### 8.7.2. Evaluation of a Change Request Proposal
A CRP is processed by appropriate SWG. The SWG shall discuss the proposed CRP and then vote on how the CRP should be processed:

- reject the CRP with a written reason;
- accept the CRP but request additional clarification; or
- accept the CRP with documentation as submitted.

If a CRP is accepted, the SWG will incorporate the contents of the CRP into the designated Standard, either as a revision or a corrigendum. If the CRP is rejected, then the SWG must write a formal response to the CRP submitter(s), or log the response in the Issue tracker, explaining the rationale for rejection and then allow the submitter(s) the opportunity to respond and/or resubmit their CRP with modifications.

### 8.7.3. Completion of a Change Request Proposal
When a SWG has processed a CRP, the status of the CRP will be updated in the tracker used. The status and disposition will be modified based on the SWG decisions. The CRP will remain available for future reference.
